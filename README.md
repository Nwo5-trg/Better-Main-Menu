# Nwo5's Better Main Menu
This is a silly little menu mod that revamps the main menu.

Right now the mod adds:
- A sidebar to the main menu
- A overhauled button system for the main menu
- A widgets menu that doesnt have many features actually because idk what to add

I definitely want suggestions for features so if you have any lmk and I'll try to add them

Todo:
- Make widgets actually useful
- Stats display maybe somewhere somehow
- Maybe add an option for image buttons even though that might be annoying
